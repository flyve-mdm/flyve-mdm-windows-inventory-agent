The Windows Inventory Agent features a complete inventory of your Windows devices where both hardware and software information is collected.

After you [Install the app](http://flyve.org/windows-inventory-agent/), you must define the server address and credentials where the inventory will be sent in the Global Settings section.

Also you will find the Privacy options, where you can decide what information will be sent between these two options Health Reports and Usage Data.

Inventory Agent can also send inventory to:

* Inventory for GLPI 2.3.x and higher
* OCSInventory NG (ocsng) 1.3.x and 2.x
* Mandriva Pulse2

To get the inventory tap in Run inventory now from the main screen, and it will automatically send the inventory report to your server address.

Also you can see your Inventory before sending it with Show my inventory, from there you will be able to share it in an XML or JSON format through email, bluetooth, etc.
